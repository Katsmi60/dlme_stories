The Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) is designed to provide global access to significant collections of cultural heritage material from around the world.  University students in Jordan, tourists in London, scholars in Cairo, and secondary school students in Japan will all have access to digital records from museum, library, archive, manuscript, and intangible heritage collections. These records tell the story of the Middle East from prehistory to today.

Accompanying that important service is a critical cultural heritage preservation effort. By providing inventories, cataloguing and documenting objects, and digitizing records, the DLME directly supports the worldwide effort to combat looting and the illicit trade in cultural heritage objects and pushes back against the forces that would plunder our culture to finance terror and oppress people.

Inventories allow museum and library directors to know exactly what they have in case of catastrophic loss. Digitization and federation into the DLME makes records available to law enforcement colleagues around the world. Cataloguing provides provenance information to the art market. And photographic and 3D documentation allow for identification of objects that have disappeared due to trafficking.

This exhibit explains how the DLME works with partners around the world to help preserve and protect our shared cultural heritage.

There are the principal ways that the Digital Library of the Middle East protects cultural heritage.

## Digital Documentation to Protect Collections

Providing concrete documentation is one of the first challenges many countries face in trying to stop the sale of looted cultural objects from museums or archives. Documentation of these objects is critical for their protection and the impact of this protection can be amplified when that documentation is digitized. By providing a platform for inventories of digitized cultural heritage databases, the DLME helps countries in need as well as international law enforcement protect artifacts from trafficking by making those objects readily identifiable.

In March 2017 the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2347. This resolution outlines steps that member nations can take to secure cultural heritage collections and reduce risk of loss of objects.

The Digital Library of the Middle East is providing an on the ground solution that directly support the efforts of UN member states and affiliate organizations. A look at Article 17 of Resolution 2347, which eloquently sets forth a number of well-considered steps for cultural heritage preservation, shows how. Section A suggests a first step for Member States to take by, quote:

Introducing or improving cultural heritage and properties’ local and national inventory lists, including through digitalized information when possible, and making them easily accessible to relevant authorities and agencies, as appropriate;

Resolution 2347 also calls for establishing databases that collect information on criminal activities and on cultural material removed from conflict zones to ensure repatriation. Both these are initiatives we are working on as well.

The DLME actively encourages new inventory and digitization projects through joint fundraising collaborations with Middle Eastern partners. These newly inventoried and digitized collections become easily accessible through the DLME digital platform. And the DLME does its part to implement international cultural heritage mandates as proposed by the Untied Nations.

# EXAMPLES OF HOW INVENTORIES HELP RETURN LOOTED OBJECTS

In 2003 when the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad was looted, thousands of artifacts went missing. Artifacts excavated from famous archaeological expeditions like the excavations of Ur, Iraq in the 1920s fell victim to the looting. Fortunately, documentation of objects has not only helped law enforcement search for items, but track them down for return.

In 2006 the United States returned the 4,400 year old statue of the Sumerian King Entemena of Lagash to Iraq after the artifact appeared in the FBI’s Top Ten Art Crimes. Documentation of this artifact and the sharing of information through the FBI Art Crime Unit helped secure the statue’s safe return.

In 2015, US Special Forces conducted a raid deep in Syria against ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf. Found in the operation was a stash of artifacts and paperwork that government sources say conclusively proves that ISIS was trafficking antiquities to fund its operations. Among the finds were objects that included registration numbers from the Mosul Museum that were looted by the terrorists. Because the museum had inventoried and clearly marked the objects, they were easily identifiable and repatriated to the Iraqi government.

While museums are the most likely collections to be archived, they are not the only collections at risk of looting. Artifacts that have been excavated and remain in storage facilities can often be at even greater risk, particularly when the storage facilities are in remote areas and archaeological sites. Documentation is equally important for these types of objects that are often at risk during conflicts. In 1967, French archaeologist Maurice Dunand discovered the Sidon Bull’s Head at the Temple of Eshmun in Lebanon. Upon discovery, Dunand and his team catalogued and photographed the valuable artifact. As Lebanon’s civil war widened in 1979, the artifact was taken to an underground bunker for safekeeping where it was later stolen during the war. After surfacing on the U.S. market and being acquired by American collectors, the Bull’s Head was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2010 – the same year Dunand’s documentation archives were handed over to the Lebanese government. In 2016, Met Curator Thomas Campbell notified Lebanon that they had matched the Bull’s Head to ithe Dunand archives. The Manhattan District Attorney seized the artifact in 2017 to be returned to Lebanon.

## Supporting Law Enforcement and Raising Awareness of Missing Cultural Objects
Documentation in the DLME is not just a valuable tool for countries to prove ownership of an item, it also serves as evidence for prosecutors bringing charges in illicit trafficking and other criminal cases. A number of law enforcement databases contain information on items that have been registered as stolen, including those from INTERPOL and the Italian Carabinieri for Cultural Heritage Protection. Comparing forfeited or seized artifacts with stolen items in legal databases as well as documented artifacts in collections online, like those found in the Digital Library of the Middle East, can help provide a trail of documented evidence to support law enforcement.

Another way the DLME can help is with customs enforcement. Because the database is readily available on smartphones and tablets, customs officials around the world can check comparable photographic records and look for similar objects when they are faced with a questionable import. Though this would not necessarily match any particular object, close similarity can alert officials to seek expert guidance in establishing the provenance and legality of imported objects.

Provenance records provide another level of important information. These show the history of ownership and when. how, and from whom an artifact was acquired. It helps establish that an artifact is not a forgery, been altered, or was looted and illicitly trafficked. These data are critical for the art market by helping to establishing legitimate ownership of materials.

## Access to Digitized Manuscript and Library Archives
Creating global access to information is the purpose of a digital library. Digitization of materials such as historic manuscripts and archives opens access for a wider community to learn from these materials. Valuable historic documents from original text of laws to ancient Islamic manuscripts or Egyptian papyri all hold information that a new generation can learn from. Digitizing such documents not only provides access to a global audience but permanently preserves them and the meaning they carry.

UNESCO advocates the value of access to one’s heritage and history as a human right. Much of that personal history exists in the kind of records that so many families and communities maintain - birth certificates, family trees, deeds and government records, religious materials, and photographs. For many displaced people in the Middle East, especially in conflict zone, these records are under threat from destruction caused by conflict.

The scourge of looting and illicit trafficking affects manuscripts and other library collections as well. Katie Paul of the Antiquities Coalition has identified Facebook pages that offer private manuscript materials for sale from Syria and Iraq without provenance. Law enforcement officials who have seen these weblinks believe that the material is stolen.

DLME Labs and Research
3D Documentation
The DLME encourages advanced 3D documentation of cultural objects. This  documentation technique offers a 3D replica of a tangible heritage objects that is manipulable within the digital platform. These 3D records serve as an resource for advanced technological applications, including in virtual, mixed, and augmented reality applications and 3D printing.

Research
The Digital Library of the Middle East works with SREO Research of Gaziantep, Turkey and Mosul, Iraq to research the current state of libraries in collections in conflict areas. This ongoing research seeks to identify libraries and other cultural collections at risk and plan for practical and implementable interventions that can preserve and protect cultural heritage assets from the ravages of war.


Training and capacity building
Recognizing that inventory, cataloguing, registration, documentation, and technical skills are critical to the work of cultural heritage preservation, the DLME is committed to working with partner collections to build organization and staff capacity in areas necessary for collections preservation and rationalization.




A Worldwide Response
The Digital Library of the Middle East focuses on materials from the MENA region and gratefully federates any appropriate collection from any region of the world. However, we are not alone in recognizing the importance of inventories, digitization, and access. Digital Libraries throughout the world are building collections with the goals of access to important information and of securing collections.

Our report, Implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 2347: The Critical Role of Digital Libraries was submitted to UNESCO and reports on a sample of major international digital libraries and their exemplary work of international cooperation and cultural heritage preservation.
